# predicting_future_sales

Using the Multi-Layer Perceptron Regressor to predict sales on each item for the 34th month given sales trend of the 33 months prior (January 2013 to October 2015). This project is one of the available [competitions in kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/competitive-data-science-predict-future-sales/data).

NOTES:
* The notebook features the Data Analysis, Visualization, Wrangling, Cleaning, and Transformation steps that I did to maximize my model output for the competition.
* This is an ongoing project, and therefore, is not a complete solution to the problem
* Focus in this update is more on the Data Analysis than the model output. Model Optimizations will be implemented soon.
